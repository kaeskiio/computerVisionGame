# Celebrity Guessing Game - Inspired by Dr. Guha Balakrishnan's Computer Vision Work

## Overview
This project is a celebrity guessing game developed in Python using the Pygame library. Inspired by Dr. Guha Balakrishnan's work in computer vision, this game challenges players to identify celebrities based on their images. The game is designed to be simple, engaging, and fun, leveraging basic image display and interaction techniques.

## Features
- **Image Display**: Presents random chunks of images of celebrities for the player to identify.
- **User Interaction**: Players can select from multiple-choice answers to guess the celebrity's name.
- **Game Logic**: The game tracks correct answers and provides feedback to the player.
- **Responsive UI**: The interface is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing.

## Development
- **Python**: The programming language used for implementing the game logic and structure.
- **Pygame**: A powerful library for handling game development, including rendering graphics, managing user input, and controlling game flow.

## How It Works
1. **Game Initialization**: The game starts by initializing the Pygame environment and loading a set of celebrity images.
2. **Image Display**: A celebrity image is displayed on the screen, and the player is prompted to guess the name.
3. **User Selection**: The player selects an answer from multiple choices, which is then checked for correctness.

## Credits
This game was inspired by Dr. Guha Balakrishnan's research in computer vision and was developed to explore the basics of image-based game design using Pygame.
